# Backlog

A repository for alternative solutions, app replacements, functional versions, and other archived setups / apps that still deserve a place.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a collection of alternative solutions, app replacements, functional versions, and other archived setups that continue to hold value. It is designed to be accessible to the public, offering resources that might not be easily found elsewhere.

## Notes

- Some things might be rough, experimental, or semi-abandoned.
- No promises on updates, support, or polish.
- Use, tweak, or ignore at your own risk.
- Some content is mirrored from original sources to ensure it remains available to the public. If you are the owner of any material and want it removed, please open an issue or contact me directly.

## Structure

Things are grouped loosely by category or purpose. Expect some chaos.
